# Project Readme

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of a MIPS pipelined datapath with a data hazard solution and a two-level cache memory. The objective is to create an efficient and high-performance datapath that can execute MIPS instructions while mitigating data hazards and utilizing cache memory for improved memory access.

## Methodology

Our team adopted a systematic and collaborative approach to complete the project successfully. The methodology involved the following steps:

1. Requirement Analysis: We collectively analyzed the project requirements, including the MIPS instruction set, data hazards, and cache memory specifications. This analysis helped us understand the functionality and constraints of the system.
2. Datapath Design: Based on the requirements, we designed the MIPS pipelined datapath, considering the stages of instruction fetch, instruction decode, execution, memory access, and write back. We incorporated mechanisms to handle data hazards, such as forwarding and stalling.
3. Cache Memory Design: I designed a two-level cache memory system, consisting of CacheL1 and CacheL2 components. This allowed for specialization and efficiency, as I was able to focus on implementing each cache component to the best of my ability.
4. Individual Component Development: Team members worked on their assigned components independently, implementing the datapath and cache memory according to the design specifications. We focused on code modularity, readability, and adherence to VHDL standards.
5. Testing and Integration: After completing the individual component development, we conducted extensive testing on each component to ensure correct functionality. We then integrated the components to create a unified system, testing the interactions and overall performance.
6. Data Hazard Solution: We implemented techniques such as forwarding (data bypassing) and stalling to handle data hazards in the pipelined datapath. These techniques ensured correct data propagation and prevented hazards that could result in incorrect execution.
7. Documentation: We maintained comprehensive documentation throughout the project, including design choices, implementation details, testing procedures, and code explanations. This documentation serves as a valuable resource for understanding and future maintenance of the system.
